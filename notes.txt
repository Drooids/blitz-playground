    1. Include header files as per default
    2. When our application runs, the operating system needs to be able to find the dll file.
       Copy _dependency_.dll and put it either your project's working directory (where the vcxproj file is at), or inside of the system directory. C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 is the 32bit windows system directory and C:\Windows\SysWOW64 is the 64bit system directory of 32bit applications.
